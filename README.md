# AwtySM (Awty Social Media)

I created AwtySM because I saw how my peers often connected digitally. There was one problem though: a lack of unity. Each clique communicated separately on different platforms. AwtySM is my attempt at providing a universal social platform for students. This branch uses the Awty website account database, requiring users to login with their Awty website credentials.

## Estimation Equations

### Time (in days) it takes to use b bytes of storage for chat logging

    (x (students) * y (hours spent sending one message a minute) * 60 (seconds per minute) * 100 bytes (max message size approx.)  / b bytes (days with available capacity)

In this project, I chose to use AGPL because it inherently satisfies the project's legal obligations/needs.
