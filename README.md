# AwtySM (Awty Social media)
I created AwtySM because I saw how my peers often connected digitally. There was one problem though: a lack of unity. Each clique communicated separately on different platforms. AwtySM is my attempt at providing a universal social platform for students. This branch requires users to input the account credentials that they use to login to the Awty website. This would utilize the Awty account database.
