# AwtySM (Awty Social Media)
I created AwtySM because I saw how my peers often connected digitally. There was one problem though: a lack of unity. Each clique communicated separately on different platforms. AwtySM is my attempt at providing a universal social platform for students. This branch uses the Awty website account database, requiring users to login with their Awty website credentials.
