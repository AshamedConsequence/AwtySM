# AwtySM (Awty Social media)
I created AwtySM because I saw how my peers often connected digitally. There was one problem though: a lack of unity. Each clique communicated separately on different platforms. AwtySM is my attempt at providing a universal social platform for students. This branch requires users to input the account credentials that they use to login to the Awty website (no account creation). This would utilize the Awty account database with a synchronization script, which would reflect all changes made in the parent db (Awty account db) in the Awtysm database.
